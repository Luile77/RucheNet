# Introduction
Faced with the ecological emergency represented by the global decline of bee populations, technological initiatives like "RucheNet" emerge as promising solutions to reverse this alarming trend. The project "RucheNet: Intelligent Surveillance and Management of Bee Colonies in Saint Cyr" is at the heart of this innovative approach, aiming to provide beekeepers with advanced monitoring and management tools for their hives.

The importance of bees in pollination, and by extension, in the preservation of biodiversity and food security is well documented. However, these essential pollinators are threatened by a multitude of factors, including diseases, parasites, the use of pesticides, climate changes, and habitat destruction. These threats, combined with the complexity of apicultural ecosystems, make traditional hive management both difficult and imprecise.

In response to these challenges, the "RucheNet" project proposes an integrated system of sensors and a real-time data platform to provide a precise and detailed overview of the health and activity of hives. This tool allows beekeepers in Saint Cyr to make informed and proactive decisions for the well-being of their colonies, thereby improving productivity and contributing to the sustainability of apiculture.

The project relies on collaboration between beekeepers and engineers to develop a solution that not only meets the specific needs of the hives in Saint Cyr but also serves as a model for similar initiatives in other regions. Through a participatory approach, "RucheNet" aims to equip the apicultural community with innovative tools to effectively face current and future threats, thus ensuring the sustainability of bee colonies and, by extension, the health of the ecosystems to which they are indispensable.

# The Importance of Bees in Ecosystems and Agriculture

Bees are key pollinating agents, essential for the reproduction of many wild plants and agricultural crops. Their role in pollination not only contributes to the biodiversity of ecosystems but also to global food security, with about one-third of food crops depending on insect pollination (Klein et al., 2007). This interdependence highlights the importance of maintaining healthy and robust bee populations.

Bees are facing multiple threats, including parasites like the Varroa Destructor, diseases, exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides, climate change, and habitat loss (Goulson et al., 2015). These factors contribute to colony collapse disorder, resulting in significant losses for beekeepers and jeopardizing the vital ecosystem services bees provide.

Recently, IoT technologies and sensor systems have increasingly been applied to apiculture, offering new possibilities for real-time monitoring of bee colonies. These systems allow tracking various parameters, such as temperature, humidity, hive weight, and bee activity, providing valuable data for proactive colony management (Fernandez-Carames et al., 2018). These tools represent significant potential to improve bee health and hive productivity.

Despite these advancements, many existing systems have limitations, including cost, complexity of use, and durability under harsh conditions. Furthermore, integrating collected data into practical management practices remains a challenge. The "RucheNet" project seeks to address these gaps by developing an integrated and accessible solution, specifically tailored to the needs of beekeepers in Saint Cyr. Through close collaboration between beekeepers and engineers, "RucheNet" aims to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for bee colony monitoring and management.

# Mission and Objectives

The mission of "RucheNet" is to provide an innovative, reliable platform for the real-time monitoring of beehives, catering to the urgent demands of beekeepers and researchers alike. At a time when environmental challenges are severely affecting bee populations, "RucheNet" stands as an indispensable resource. By meticulously tracking essential parameters such as temperature, humidity, hive weight, and ambient light exposure, the initiative does more than merely collect data; it opens a gateway to understanding the vitality and well-being of bee colonies. This, in turn, plays a pivotal role in enhancing global food security and conserving biodiversity.

# Technical Approach

"RucheNet" is grounded in a commitment to accuracy and dependability, leveraging state-of-the-art IoT technologies to ensure precise data collection and immediate delivery from beehives. By integrating a combination of carefully selected sensors with a resilient data transmission framework (LoRaWAN), "RucheNet" ensures that beekeepers and researchers are equipped with timely, actionable insights. This empowers them to make informed decisions that bolster the health and productivity of bee colonies. Furthermore, "RucheNet" incorporates advanced data analytics to interpret the collected data, providing a comprehensive view of each hive's status and highlighting potential issues before they become critical. This proactive approach to beehive management marks a significant advancement in apiculture, setting a new standard for technological interventions in the field.
